         <!--TODO: BUY SELECTION AND END GAME-->

         <div>After the selection phase, you enter the buy phase.  During the buy phase, you spend your money and gems to buy new cards and enhancements.  If you busted during the selection phase, you must choose between scoring points or buying.</div>
         <div>Money earned during the selection phase will disappear after the buy phase.  Gems earned will continue to carry over to future rounds.  Always spend your money, but it may be a good strategy to hold on to your gems.</div>
         <div>Spend your money on new cards.  Some cards have different point values.  The higher the points, the more effect the card has and the further it moves you along the game board.  Buying higher point value cards is always a good strategy.</div>
         <div>You can only purchase one card from each effect (but as many cards as you want as long as they are all distinct effects).</div>
         <div>Spend your gems on enhancements.  An enhancement can sometimes just be applicable during the buy phase, but oftentimes will apply for the remainder of the game.</div>
         <div>Only one enhancement can be purchased each round, so make sure you spend your gems if you have an abundance. There is an enhancement you can buy to enable a second enhancement to be purchased and a second card of the same effect to be purchased.</div>
